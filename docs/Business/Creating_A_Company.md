# Process to Create a Company:

## Why Create A Company

**Benefits**
* **You have a money-holding entity that is separate from you legally.** If the company gets bankrupt or sued, your personal assets are not affected (to an extent. More info (LINK HERE)).
* **You're taxed differently.** As a person, you're taxed based on your income. As a company, you're taxed based on your profits.
* **You want to hire people:** As some as you hire someone full-time and pay them, you're handing that person income that needs to be taxed by the government.
* **Other companies take you seriously:** Before I created my company, no one took my request for manufacturing seriously.

## What Kind of Company Do I Want?

It's pretty simple and you can read more about it in the future, but in short:

* **Sole Proprietorship:** No legal separation from your company, but it's a lot cheaper to file. Usually no point.
* **Limited Liability Company (LLC):** Legal Separation from your company, but not the best option if you're looking for venture capital funding.
* **SCorp:** The best bet if you're looking for venture capital funding.

I had kickstarter funding so I just went with an LLC. The rest of this guide is on how to create an LLC. An SCorp is much more involved and requires a lawyer.

## Where do I want to file it?

The biggest place right now is Delaware, because it's cheap and there are a lot of structure in place to help your company.

> Common Misunderstanding: taxes don't depend on where the company is registered, but rather where it operates. 

Massachusetts has a $400 yearly fee, wheras Delaware has a $180 yearly fee, although if you do not live in Delaware, you need to have a company like Harvard Business Services be your Delaware residential representative, which is $50 a year.

Massachuetts will create and recognize your company the same day and the interface is online. Delaware is solely through a mailed physical copy and takes one day with no fees to file. You can expedite the process if you like.

## Creating A Company
You need the following to start a company:

* **Tax ID #**: You'll file it from the IRS
* **Company Registration**: After you have a Tax ID, you can register yourself as a company.
* **Legal Paperwork**: If you're starting this company with someone, you need to file paperwork that states how the profits will be shared.
* **A Separate Email Address:** You need to separate your business and your personal accounts as much as possible. Gmail is the best option.
* **A Bank Account:** Creating a business bank account will make filing taxes a lot easier in the future. More on that in another blog.
