# How to Create a Business Bank Account

Creating a business bank account is easy. You only need a couple documents:

* Your ID
* Your Tax ID
* Physical Evidence of the Company's Registration

## Bank fees

There are a couple fees that people should be aware of when deciding which bank to use. Always ask what hidden fees there are, but setting up a business bank account is essentially free; You just need to transfer some money initially into the bank to activate it.

> This may differ between bank to bank

There are also often fees associated with the following (Be sure to check):

* **Number of Transactions:** Banks sometimes cap the number of transactions in and out of your bank account.
* **Minimum Balance:** If you don't have at least their required minimum balance, you might pay a fee.
* **Minimum Spending Fee:** You must spend or use a minimum amount of money from the account per week.

There may be more fees, but these are also the fees solely associated with the creation and maintenance of the bank. There are fees also associated with credit cards, debit cards, VISA versus Mastercard, etc.

> The best thing you can do is walk into the bank you choose and ask them all the questions regarding fees. Read the paperwork: some big banks are known to drown small companies in fees. Small banks are usually sweet

## Small Bank or Big Bank

In my business, I originally started with a small bank because they had no fees and allowed me to make multiple transactions without fear. I later switched to a big bank because they allowed me to pay my manufacturers online, gave me 1% cash back, and supported international wires. As some of my manufacturers were from China and India, I needed that ability.

**Benefits of a Small Bank Versus a Big Bank**
* **Support:** Small banks will call you if anything happens that's awry. I had a friend call in on my behalf to find out more about whether the small bank supported international wiring. They immediately called me after and asked me if that person was qualified to call.
* **Best for Low Cash Businesses:** If you're starting off with only a couple hundred dollars, you're best bet is to create a business bank account with a small bank. They have no fees and you can call them for anything.

**Benefits of a Big Bank versus a Small Bank**
* **International Wiring:** When you make a payment to a company abroad, they'll give you international wiring details. Most small banks don't have the capability to make those international transactions, even if you walk into their place.
* **A Better Online Banking:** Small banks don't have their online banking quite perfected yet. I found I couldn't wire money to another bank and the interface was horrendous.
* **Cash Back:** If you're like me and spending a lot of money on manufacturing, having cash back just gives you free money in your pocket that you didn't have earlier.

## Things to know about your bank

* **Adding Workers with Business cards:** You can supply people who work for you directly with business cards and give them a cash limit.
* **Wiring Fees:** Sending money between companies
 * **Check:** It's free and lots of contractors prefer to be paid in check, so always keep your checkbook close.
 * **Wiring:** There's usually a flat fee associated with the wiring.
 * **Paypal:** Paypal is the best in my opinion, but it costs around 2.7% of your purchase to send money through Paypal. You can send money to friends for no cash back, but direct costs require money.
* **Business Credit:** In case you want to make loans in the future, it's best to start creating business credit. Putting purchases on your credit card helps do that (And gives you cash back!)
* **Don't be late on your payments:** The interest fee for bank accounts is absurdly high. Don't make payments on your credit cards or direct loans from your credit card. You'll basically be drowning in debt the minute you do.
