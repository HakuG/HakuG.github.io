# How to Build a Company

> Moving from Design to Manufacturing


## How this is structured

**Introduction**: Going from Maker to Manufacturing

**Business:**
* **Process to Create a Company:** Forming a Sole Proprietorship, LLC, SCorp, etc.
* **Setting up a Corporate Bank Account:** Small banks or large banks?
* **Money and Taxes:** How do I manage payroll, credit cards, etc.
* **Documents:** Money management documents you need when you talk to manufacturers

**Electrical Design of Watches:**
* **Block Diagram and Component Selection:** The Ultimate Plan
* **PCB Design:** How to think about PCB Design moving forward
* **Programming:** How to Program and things to be aware of
* **Problems and Iterations:** Problems with the current watch and future iterations

**Mechanical Design of Watches:**
* **Block Diagram and Component Selection:** The Ultimate Plan
* **Design and Considerations:** CAD Model everything or else everything will go wrong
* **Programming:** How we got the laser cutter to work.

**Manufacturers:**
* **How to reach out to manufacturers:** Documents you should and shouldn't send them.
* **How to find quality manufacturers:** They're hard to find, but they're damn good.

**Computer Science**
* **Building Customization Software:** Probably not important to you, but required for my own documentation

**Manufacturing for EE:**
* **Design for Manufacturing PCB**: Circuit routing techniques to prepare for mass manufacturing
* **Design for Manufacturing PCBA**: Preparing for PCBA so your manufacturer doesn't get confused.
* **China PCB and PCBA Companies**: When they're good and when they're not
* **Boston PCBA Manufacturers**: The top PCBA manufacturers
* **Box Build:** How to prepare yourself for Box Build

**Manufacturing for ME:**
* **Tolerances:** If you don't work with tolerances, you ***WILL*** have problems in manufacturing
* **Chinese Laser Cutters:** The most horrible machines if you don't know what you're doing, your best friend if you do
* **Working with Wood:** The difficulties of working with wood

**Insanely Fast Prototyping:**
* **3D Printing:** The best 3D printing material and machines, down to a science.
* **Electrical Engineering:** The fastest way to prototype electrical.
* This is a blog I will use to talk about best practices to make prototypes quicker and quicker.
