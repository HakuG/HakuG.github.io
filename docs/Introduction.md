### Introduction

This guide is meant for people who want to go from being a maker to manufacturing. If you're a maker who's still on the fence on whether or not you should move to manufacturing, peruse this guide as a case study. I hope you find that it's not as scary as you may think.

When I started, I was terrified. A quantity of three hundred and fifty may not sound like much when you compare it to what large companies are churning out, but as a person who had just graduated college without an engineering degree, the challenge left me with multiple anxiety attacks.

> Don't worry, I'm fine now.

However, as the days progressed, my anxiety faded and my confidence and creativity grew tenfold. I saw everything with a different perspective, marveled at engineering feats I had originally ignored, and appreciated the world around me more. I would spend hours looking at water bottles, wooden countertops, cell phone cases, wondering about the costs of manufacturing and how I could manufacture the same piece.

> It was addicting.

If you're a maker and you've done something kinda cool and unique, just try to go into manufacturing. You'll learn a ton.

### The Benefits of Manufacturing

* You learn a lot
* It's cool to see people around you the appreciate your designs
* You obtain an incredible business mindset for future designs
* You gain lots of connections and friends
* You start to realize how important electrical and mechanical equations are in your designs
* Your brain starts going 100mph after your first maker to manufacturing run
* You get lots of free time once everything is up and running to build your next design


### The Cons of Manufacturing

* You probably won't make any money in your first batch
* Your first batch will take months to perfect, and even then you'll find it shitty
* It'll take hours of your free time and your weekend
* You will find yourself constantly frustrated by small issues that blow up in manufacturing
* You will find yourself spending hours of free time doing small tasks
* You'll try to go to China by yourself and realize how annoying that can be.

> In my opinion, if you're trying to do this for money, you need support. Luckily, you can find that support by reaching out to your local government, college, or consulting company. Some people will do it for free, others will not.

### ** Just do it. Even if you fail, fail now so you don't fail later. **
